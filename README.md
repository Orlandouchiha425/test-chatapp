1) still working on mongo --- so is not saving nothing on mongo
2) for now to make it run you first need to npm i, cd to socket folder, run nodemon.
the file index.js contains socket io server and needs to connect to src. thats the purpose of origin:https://  thats the src folder


3) src/appjs contains where it connects to backend 

4) run local host 3000  add name, room and then connect (do not send message just yet because no one else is in that room)

5) open another tab on localhost and again add name, select room number and then connect.Then send a message
